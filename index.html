    <p>
        My favorite hobby is reading books since it opens doors to a variety of sets and experiences. 
        Angie Thomas, my favorite author,address important societal concerns through fascinating storylines.
         "The Hate U Give" is a work of art, that fuses genuine emotions with social commentary and sheds awareness 
         on racial injustice and police brutality. 
         Thomas's character development and storytelling have a strong emotional resonance, making her work both thought-provoking
         and uplifting. I find peace, empathy, and a deeper understanding of the human condition via books, 
         and Angie Thomas' words have left an everlasting impact on my heart, demonstrating the power of literature in shaping perceptions.
